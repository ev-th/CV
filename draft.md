## Profile

I’m a language-agnostic software developer that’s fascinated by how people use and make things. Previously as a Product Manager at a fashion company, I came to appreciate tech’s role in how customers interacted with us and used our products. To engage more deeply with this, I taught myself some programming and discovered the power of software to solve many of our problems. Now a graduate of Makers Academy, I continue to enjoy building tools to make people’s lives easier and better, whether that’s by simply shaving a few seconds from a boring task, or empowering them to change the way they move through the world.
