## Profile

I’m a language-agnostic software developer that’s fascinated by how people make things and use them to move through the world, interact with others and improve their lives. Previously as a Product Development Manager at a fashion company, I came to appreciate tech’s role in how customers interacted with us and used our products. Digging deeper, I taught myself some programming and discovered the power of software to solve many of our problems. Now a graduate of Makers Academy, I continue to enjoy using tech to build tools to make people’s lives easier.

## Software Development Experience

### Makers Academy - (April - July 2023)

- Followed **Agile best practices** to build software as part of **teams of 5 - 7 devs**. By far the most rewarding part of the bootcamp, this brought home the importance of **effective communication, strong ticket creation, effective use of Git and Github, and thorough testing**.
- Built **full stack web apps**, both from scratch, and extended from legacy code. 
- Built a **mobile app** using React Native that uses multiple third party APIs.
- Designed both **SQL and NoSQL databases** using PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Discovered the pros and cons of both the hard way.
- **Switched quickly between various languages and frameworks**, such as Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Express, and Sinatra, **independently learning** them as and when needed. Learned when to quickly pivot when the wrong choice of tech has been made.
- Used **test-driven development** (TDD) throughout with various testing frameworks, such as Jest, Rspec and Cypress.
- Built a strong foudation of **object-oriented design** and developed a good technique for **refactoring** by ensuring code is tested before making changes (can you tell I'm a fan of testing?).
