## Profile

I'm a language-agnostic software developer recently trained at Makers Academy. My previous experience as a Product Development Manager in the fashion industry has given me a strong user-focus and understanding of the product life cycle. I'd love to be part of a diverse team working on software that's a joy to use.

## Engineering Experience

### Makers Academy (March-July 2023)

- Followed **Agile best practices** to build software as part of **teams of 5 - 7 devs**, strengthening skills of **effective communication, strong ticket creation, good use of Git and Github, pair programming, and thorough testing**.
- Built **full stack web and mobile apps**, developed user-friendly front ends and well crafted APIs.
- Designed and used both **SQL and NoSQL databases** using PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- **Switched quickly between various languages and frameworks**, learning them as and when needed.
- Used **test-driven development** (TDD) throughout with various testing frameworks, such as Jest, Rspec and Cypress.
- Built a strong foundation of **object-oriented design** using Ruby and Javascript in several solo challenges.

## Skills

### Big Picture View

I take care to understand how the various moving parts of a company work together to build and release a successful product. As a Product Development Manager at a small business, I wore many hats, working on product design and development, all the way to release and shipping. This gave me valuable insight into how all stages of the product lifecycle are connected and inform each other. For that role, this meant developing an understanding of global supply chains: the options they gave us and the issues that could (and did) arise from them. It also meant taking into account possible production practices and associated costs while designing product, or merchandising a website informed by knowledge of social media marketing or packaging and shipping. During Makers group projects, this skill was useful for splitting tickets effectively while still taking into account how they interact with each other, and never losing sight of the project's larger goal while working on database schema or a React component for example.

### User Focus and Communication

In all my professional roles, I have been in close proximity to the end user, often communicating with them directly. Both in care and retail, being able to listen to and understand a user and adapt communication styles for them was vital. In product development, I consistently worked on adapting our strategy based on what sold well and how the customer was using our products. With a variety of customer roles, such as online retail, wholesale, or marketing partners, users were not a monolith so product and communication had to be adaptable. I also find working in teams to be incredibly rewarding. In small in-person teams while working in care, the day-to-day work was unpredictable. I developed the skills to communicate when I needed help and provide support to those who needed it when I was capable. At Sukrew, I liaised daily with global team members in China, India and Hungary. I was able to adjust my communication style based on their technical knowledge, listen to and articulate their priorities, and manage expectations when necessary.

### Prioritising

I am able to effectively prioritise tasks using limited time and resources. At a fashion retail company, I identified changes that could save time and money, such as moving to a more user-friendly e-commerce platform, and working with more specialised manufacturers. Prioritising these when faced with many other day-to-day urgent tasks was difficult to sell to the director, but the business became profitable, and is now scaling much more easily because of these changes. This skill translated well into our final project at Makers, when tasked with completing our MVP by the end of day two. Despite coming up with a much more complex product during ideation, I found ways to strip away as many features as possible while leaving the core idea intact. This meant we had a working MVP to test out well within our deadline, and a great foundation from which to begin adding features.
