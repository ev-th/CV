## Evan Thomas

I’m a language-agnostic software developer that’s fascinated by how people use and make things. Previously as a Product Manager at a fashion company, I came to appreciate tech’s role in how customers interacted with us and used our products. To engage more deeply with this, I taught myself some programming and discovered the power of software to solve many of our problems. Now a graduate of Makers Academy, I continue to enjoy building tools to make people’s lives easier and better, whether that’s by simply shaving a few seconds from a boring task, or empowering them to change the way they move through the world.

## Work Experience

**SUKREW** (09/2016 to 10/2022)  
_Product Development Manager_

- Managed the complete lifecycle of the product (underwear): design, development, fittings, orders,
  shipment, quality control, stock management, product launch and sales analysis. Improved product quality and reduced costs by transitioning to specialised factories and maintained relationships with production teams in China and India.
- Designed the development process and solidified best practices. Implemented a system for good record keeping. Formalised documentation.
- Maintained the website by updating the home page, products, SEO, and managing orders. Migrated the website from Magento to Shopify which needs less technical knowledge, saving the company from expensive web development costs.
- Built software to automate wholesale order processing and store relevant information. Using the Shopify REST API, it could also retrieve and store web sale order information. This brought together data from two sales channels that were previously separated, to provide more useful sales reporting. It also saved time by reducing manual stock management and invoice generation.

**Scribbler** (2013-2015)
_Sales Assistant_

- Worked as part of a small team on the shop floor and in the stockroom.
- Communicated with the public, worked on the tills, opened/closed the shop.

Care Assistant\_

- Cared for residents in an elderly residential home, most of which had dementia.
- Distributed medication, gave personal care, prepared food, organised activities.
- Teamwork was crucial for coordinating daily tasks and adapting to unexpected events. Flexibility in
  approach was necessary for each resident’s specific needs.
- Inter-team verbal and written communication was key for an effective handover between day and
  night shifts, weekday and weekend teams.

## TODO - Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.

Here's an example

#### Communication

I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill

## Education

#### TODO - Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)

- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Queen Mary, University of London (2012 - 2016)

- MA Film Studies (Distinction)
- BA Film Studies (First Class)

#### Manchester Grammar School

- A Levels – Biology (A*), Chemistry (A), Maths (A*) – 2009-2010
- AS Level – Physics (A) – 2009
- GCSEs – 10 A-A\* including Maths and English

## TODO - Hobbies

Film nerd (love some old Hollywood glamour), fashion nerd (I make clothes and wear fun things), vegetarian cooking (my Ottolenghi books are barely holding themselves together), mindfulness (if sitting down and doing nothing counts as a hobby).
