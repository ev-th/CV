> Language-agnostic software developer recently trained at Makers. My previous experience as a Product Development Manager in the fashion industry has given me a strong user-focus and understanding of the product lifecycle. I'd love to be part of a diverse team working on software that's a joy to use.

## Skills

### Big Picture View

I take care to understand how the various moving parts of a company work together to build and release a successful product. As a Product Development Manager at a small business, I wore many hats, working on product design and development, all the way to release and shipping. This gave me valuable insight into how all stages of the product lifecycle are connected and inform each other. For that role, this meant taking into account possible production practices and associated costs while designing product, or merchandising a website informed by knowledge of social media marketing or packaging. During Makers group projects, this skill was useful for splitting tickets effectively while still taking into account how they interact with each other, and never losing sight of the project's larger goal while working on database schema or a React component for example.

### User Focus and Adaptability

In all my professional roles, I have been in close proximity to the end user, often communicating with them directly. Both in care and retail, being able to understand a user and adapt communication styles with them was vital. In product development, I consistently worked to improve sales by adapting our strategy based on what was selling well and how the customer was using our products. When designing something new and the risk didn't pay off, it was easy to change direction more quickly based on this.

### Prioritising

I am able to effectively prioritise tasks using limited time and resources. This often means finding ways to make mine and my colleagues future work easier and faster. At a fashion retail company, I identified important changes that could save time and money, such as moving to a more user-friendly e-commerce platform, and working with more specialised manufacturers. Prioritising these when faced with many other day-to-day urgent tasks was difficult to sell to the director, but the business became profitable, and is now scaling much more easily because of these changes. This skill translated well into our final project at Makers when planning our MVP, which we achieved in less than 2 days.
